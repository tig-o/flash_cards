#  Flash Cards

### Project Summary
In this project, come Sunday, I will have written a program to simulate a set of flash cards. A user will be able to see the questions, make guesses, and see a final score at the end of a round.


### Expectations
The expectation is that I will:
* write tests for each class
* write readable code
* make frequent commits
* use pull requests
